          <h2>Short Bio</h2>
         <p>Hello World! My name is Susan Winters and I live in Dallas, Texas.  I love science and technology.  
             I work in the MarTech field - which is short for Marketing and Technology. Because of my job I get to travel 
            to different conferences where I learn about the latest trends in the industry. I have been to Google and attended
        training from the best in the field of SEO and Search Engine Marketing.  I always get to meet interesting people and 
        collaborate on new projects. The photo of me on this website was taken at the SMX event in 2018. I look forward to
        traveling again and coming home with new swag.
        </p>

        <h3>Work Experience:</h3>
        <p>I am currently the Marketing Website Manager for an organization that owns several brands. I work with the Brand Managers and help them
            with the promotion of new products by creating new web pages and marketing material for our social media channels. I have recently started
            learning Salesforce and using that knowledge to create forms in their product called Marketing Cloud.  
            </p>
        </p>
        <h3>What's New:</h3>
          <p>I am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp where I am brushing up on my coding skills.  I look forward to creating new projects
              using C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL and Azure. The web page you are currently viewing is for one of my assignments. This is just a basic HTML website 
              with an external stylesheet. This project demonstrates that I can create a basic webpage with an external stylesheet and upload the files to GitHub.
